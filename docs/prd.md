## **Product Requirements Document: Go Music Queue**

* **Document Status**: Version 1.0 - Ready for Development
* **Product Name**: Go Music Queue
* **Author**: Priya, Product Manager
* **Last Updated**: 2024-10-27

## 1. Introduction

The "Go Music Queue" is a command-line interface (CLI) application for users who want a simple, local, and fast way to manage a personal "to-listen" list of music albums. Current solutions are often part of larger, more complex music applications. This project addresses the need for a minimalist, standalone tool that does one thing well. The user is a developer who is comfortable with the command line and appreciates simple, efficient tools.

## 2. Problem Statement

Music lovers often have a long backlog of albums they intend to listen to. Keeping track of this list can be cumbersome. There is a need for a lightweight, fast, and simple tool to manage this queue directly from the command line, without the overhead of a graphical user interface or a cloud-based service. The tool should make it easy to add albums, see what's in the queue, and get a random suggestion for what to listen to next.

## 3. Goals and Objectives

* **Primary Goal**: To create a functional and intuitive CLI tool that successfully manages a user's music album queue.
* **Key Objectives**:
    * Develop a single, standalone executable in Go.
    * Implement all specified commands (`import`, `add`, `next`, `list`, `count`) to meet the functional requirements.
    * Prioritize simplicity and ease of use for a command-line user.
    * Ensure the data (the queue) persists between application runs using a simple text file.

## 4. User Stories

I've broken down the features from the Project Brief into specific user stories:

* **Epic: Queue Population**
    * **Story 1: Bulk Import**: As a user, I want to import a list of albums from a text file so that I can quickly populate my queue in bulk.
    * **Story 2: Single Add**: As a user, I want to add a single album via a command-line argument so that I can quickly add a new album I just discovered.

* **Epic: Queue Management & Consumption**
    * **Story 3: Get Next Album**: As a user, I want to be given a random album from the queue so that I don't have to decide what to listen to next.
    * **Story 4: View Queue**: As a user, I want to list all the albums currently in my queue so that I can see what's available.
    * **Story 5: Check Queue Size**: As a user, I want to see a count of the albums in my queue so I know how many are left.

## 5. Functional Requirements

This section details the specific behaviors for each user story.

| **User Story** | **Requirement** | **Details & Acceptance Criteria** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Bulk Import | `queue import <filename.txt>` | **Given** a text file with one album per line, **when** I run the import command, **then** each album is added to `queue.txt` and a summary is printed. **Criteria**: Must perform a case-insensitive duplicate check. |
| Single Add | `queue add "Artist - Album"` | **Given** an album string in quotes, **when** I run the add command, **then** the album is appended to `queue.txt`. **Criteria**: Must perform a case-insensitive duplicate check. Confirms success or duplicate status. |
| Get Next Album| `queue next` | **Given** a non-empty queue, **when** I run the next command, **then** a random album is printed to the console and removed from `queue.txt`. **Criteria**: If the queue is empty, a specific message is shown. |
| View Queue | `queue list` | **Given** a queue, **when** I run the list command, **then** all albums are printed in a numbered list. |
| Check Queue | `queue count` | **Given** a queue, **when** I run the count command, **then** a message with the total number of albums is printed. |

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

* **Performance**: All commands should execute instantly. Given the local file I/O, there should be no noticeable lag.
* **Usability**: The tool must be simple to use, with clear command names and helpful output messages.
* **Portability**: As a Go application, it should compile to a single, standalone binary with no external runtime dependencies.
* **Data Integrity**: The `queue.txt` file should never be left in a corrupted state, even if a command fails.

## 7. Success Metrics

* **Task Completion Rate**: 100% of the commands listed in the functional requirements are implemented and operate as described.
* **User Satisfaction**: The primary user (you!) finds the tool useful and easy to operate for its intended purpose.
* **Quality**: No critical bugs are found during testing (e.g., the queue file is not accidentally deleted, duplicate checks work correctly).
